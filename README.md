# AI Mental Health Companion ðŸ§ 

## Description

This project provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with a mental health care AI system built using Streamlit and LangChain. It leverages the power of Google Generative AI (GenAI) to offer supportive and actionable advice based on user-provided questions.

## Key Features

- **Mental Health Focus**: The AI focuses on mental health topics, ensuring responses are relevant and appropriate.
- **Conversational Interface**: Users can interact with the AI through a chat-like interface, fostering a natural and engaging experience.
- **Contextual Awareness**: The AI considers the context of the conversation when generating responses, providing more tailored guidance.
- **Streamlit Integration**: Streamlit simplifies deployment and user interaction, making the AI accessible through a web browser.
- **LangChain Utilization**: LangChain facilitates the AI workflow, including question-answering chain creation and prompt generation.

## Project Structure

- `ingest.py`: Preprocesses data for AI use (PDF, CSV, JSON parsing, text chunking, vector store creation).
- `app.py`: Streamlit application logic, manages user interaction, loads data, and calls the conversational chain.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all necessary Python dependencies for project execution.
- `README.md`: This file (you're reading it now!).
